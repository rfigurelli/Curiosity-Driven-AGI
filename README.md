# Curiosity-Driven AGI: Chain of Curiosity Framework

This repository introduces the original white paper proposing a new conceptual framework for the evolution of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) based on **curiosity-driven learning**.

Unlike traditional architectures that focus solely on reasoning from static information, **Chain of Curiosity** enables AI systems to **actively seek knowledge**, **generate new hypotheses**, and **expand their understanding** through recursive inquiry.  
Curiosity becomes the engine of cognition, not just a byproduct.

The framework complements the previously proposed **Hierarchical Tokens for Structured General Intelligence**, focusing not on structuring thought, but on **dynamically expanding it**.

## ðŸ§  Core Concepts

- Recursive inquiry: every answer triggers new questions.
- Autonomous hypothesis generation and testing.
- Dynamic expansion of internal knowledge representations.
- Curiosity as a directed, purposeful force.
- Moving from passive task completion to active knowledge seeking.
